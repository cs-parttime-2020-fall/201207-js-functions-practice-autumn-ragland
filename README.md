# 20 12 07 JS Functions Practice

Add comments above each exercise solution (at minium). HTML and JS files have already been included in the assignment. Comment out any broken code before 9PM submission and provide context on what's not working.

## Exercise 1 : Function without Parameters 
Declare a function `main` that alerts the message "20 12 07 JS Functions Practice".

## Exercise 2 : Function with Parameters
Declare a function `alertMessage` that accepts one parameter and alerts the message "You message is [PARAM]". Call this function in the main function.

## Exercise 3 : Functions with Added Logic
Declare a function `whileLoopPrompt` that prompts a user to enter any value until they enter q. Once the user enters q alert the message "You entered q". Call this function in the main function.

## Exercise 4 : Functions with a Return Value
Declare a function `isDivisibleBy2` that takes one parameter and returns `true` if the parameter is divisible by 2 and false if the parameter is not divisible by 2. Prompt the user to enter a number. Call the function `isDivisibleBy2` passing in the user's number and save the return value. Alert the message "It is [RETURN_VALUE] that [USER_NUM] is divisible by 2"

----------
For example,

If the user enters 4 the alert should say : _It is true that 4 is divisible by 2_

If the user enters 7 the alert should say : _It is false that 7 is divisible by 2_
